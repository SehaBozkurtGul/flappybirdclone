# flappybirdclone
I watched Game Maker's Toolkit flappy bird video and replicated myself. I did all the visuals on my drawing tablet. Thank you then boyfriend now my husband for answering my never ending questions.

Between june 2024 and august 2024 I have spent my freetime in this project.
It helped me look at the games today and how much effort goes into it.
